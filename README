Steps to calculating your own Godwin data on reddit:

1. Setup a database on mysql of whatever table name you want
2. Reflect those changes in the database.yml file under the development section
2.a. update yer gems. You need DataMapper, that may be a bit of a pain.
3. Under tasks, you have a series of scripts. If you just run through them in this order, all will be well in your world. cd into the tasks folder, and then run these:
  ruby create_database.rb
  ruby run_sampling.rb
  ruby dump_full_csv.rb
  ruby dump_proportions_csv.rb
4. There's certainly bugs. Let me know and I will fix them.
